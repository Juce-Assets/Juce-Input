## Installing
### - Via UPM
Unity does not support resolving dependences from a git url. Because of that, you will need to add the following lines to your [manifest.json](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-manifestPrj.html).
```
"dependencies": {
   "com.unity.inputsystem": "1.0.2",
   "com.unity.textmeshpro": "3.0.4",
},
```
